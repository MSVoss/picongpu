General information
===================

This chapter aims to explain the use and structure of the built-in test-suite.

This test suite is intended to be useful for both physicists and computer scientists.
With it, known physical questions are used as a test to guarantee the correctness of the PIC code.
In this way, further developments can be checked easily.
Furthermore, it can also be used to test these physical properties in a simulation and thus be used to evaluate the simulation.

If you read this documentation like a book carry on in the order of the table of contents.
However, note the code and examples that run alongside this documentation.

To get familiar with the development of a new test case,
start with the :ref:`rough structure <structure>` of the test suite and some examples.
After looking at some examples and explaining how to build a new test case,
continue on to running a test.
For a bit more in-depth information see the Code Documentation.
