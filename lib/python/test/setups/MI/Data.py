This test allows verification of the MI. It is irrelevant whether
it is a 2D or 3D simulation. With a 3D simulation, however, attention
must be paid to the Lorentz factor (for more information, see the
bachelor thesis, for example, submitted by Mika Soren Voss).

For information:
    according to the documentation, the case distinction will
    only be incorporated in a later version, which means that
    two cases of KHI currently have to be treated differently.
