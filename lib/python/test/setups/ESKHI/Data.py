This test enables the ESKHI to be checked. It is irrelevant whether
it is a 2D or 3D simulation. In a 3D simulation, however, attention
must be paid to the Lorentz factor. Furthermore, the error in the
growth rate must be taken into account in the 2D simulation (for more
information, for example, see the bachelor thesis submitted
by Mika Soren Voss).

For information:
    according to the documentation, the case distinction will only
    be incorporated in a later version, which means that two case
    s of KHI currently have to be treated differently.
