This library contains some functions for calculating some mathematical
and physics functions, as well as some deviation calculations. It is
based on frequently used functions and is constantly being expanded.

Functions present in testsuite.Math are listed below.

physical functions:
-------------------

    calculateV_O
    calculateTime
    calculateTimeFreq
    plasmafrequence
    calculateBeta

deviation functions:
--------------------

    getDifference
    getMaxDifference
    getDifferenceInPercentage
    getAcceptanceRange
    getTestResult

mathematical functions:
-----------------------

    growthrate
