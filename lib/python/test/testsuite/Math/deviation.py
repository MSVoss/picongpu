This module contains some auxiliary functions to determine the
deviation between theory and simulation. It is not yet complete
in the present version and will be expanded over time.

Routines in this module:

getDifference(theory, simulation)->float or array:
    calculates the difference between the theory value and
    the simulation value

getMaxDifference(theory, simulation):
    calculates the maximum deviation between theory and simulation

getDifferenceInPercentage(theory, simulation):
    calculates the difference between the theory value and
    the simulation value in percentage

getAcceptanceRange(theory, acceptance:float = None):
    represents the range around the theoretical value,
    which as a limit leads to the acceptance of the test

getTestResult(theory, simulation, acceptance:float = None) -> bool:
    determines whether a test passes or fails based on the acceptance range
